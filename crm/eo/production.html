        <h2>Attendee Journey</h2>
        <p>
            The AccessFuel Platform digitally re-creates your event so you can understand who went where, when.<br/>
            Think of it as holding the 'magic wand' to your event. Where you can answer any and every question about your audience.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Benefits include optimizing the attendee journey and experience to ensure they go</h3>
        <p>
            For example, did Marketing VP's attend all the sessions they should to learn and get the most from the event?<br/> 
            Did they visit all the exhibitor booths? Did they attend the sessions most important and valuable to them (including accreditation)? 
        </p>
            
        <p>
           Overall, does the make-up of your attendees (and their interests) aligne with the goals and objectives of your Organization... as well as the content?
